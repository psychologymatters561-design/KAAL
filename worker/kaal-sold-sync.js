   KAAL — edition state worker.

   THE PROBLEM THIS CLOSES: index.html is a static site with no backend.
   `KAAL.sold` only ever changes when Arjun edits it by hand and pushes.
   Between a real sale landing and that push, the site is telling every
   other visitor a number is available when it is not — two people can
   pick the same number, pay, and only one watch exists. Razorpay's own
   stock-limit-20 stops the 21st sale; it does nothing about two people
   both landing on "07".

   THE FIX: Razorpay fires a webhook the instant a payment is captured.
   This worker verifies that webhook is genuinely from Razorpay, reads
   which number the buyer chose out of the payment's notes, and commits
   the updated `sold` array straight to index.html on GitHub. GitHub
   Pages rebuilds automatically. The gap between a sale and the site
   telling the truth about it drops from "whenever Arjun notices" to
   roughly the time it takes GitHub to rebuild a static page — seconds,
   not hours.

   WHAT WAS STILL OPEN, AND IS NOW CLOSED: the webhook fires at payment.
   Two honest buyers can both choose 07 in the minutes BEFORE either of
   them pays, and both reach checkout. One of them then gets an apology
   and a refund, which is the single worst message this brand can send.
   So there are two more routes now, and a KV namespace behind them:

     GET  /state        what is actually sold, and what is briefly held
     POST /hold {n}     claim a number for twelve minutes while paying

   A hold is advisory on purpose. It is not a lock, it is not payment,
   and it NEVER stands between a buyer and the checkout page — if the
   hold call is slow or fails, the page proceeds to Razorpay regardless.
   It exists to stop the honest collision, not a determined attacker;
   the authority on a sale is still Razorpay's stock limit and the
   webhook below.

   WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT DO: it is not a database, a cart, or an
   inventory system. It holds two small keys and edits one line of one
   file, because that is the entire footprint of "sold" in this codebase.

   WHEN TO OUTGROW IT: Workers KV is eventually consistent — a write can
   take up to about a minute to be visible everywhere. At twenty units
   that is irrelevant: the window where it matters is the window where
   two people buy within the same minute, and there are only twenty
   units in total. If this ever becomes a real cadence — a restock, a
   larger series, more than a sale a minute — move `hold` and `sold`
   into a Durable Object, which serialises writes by construction. That
   is a contained change to two functions here and nothing on the page.
   Do it when the cadence arrives, not before.

   SETUP — do this once, after your Razorpay Payment Page is live.

   1. Free Cloudflare account. `npm i -g wrangler`, then from the repo
      root: `wrangler deploy` (wrangler.toml is beside this file).
      There is still no build step; the file deploys as it is.

   2. Create the KV namespace the holds live in, once:

        wrangler kv namespace create KAAL_STATE

      Paste the id it prints into wrangler.toml. Skip this and
      everything still works exactly as it did before holds existed:
      /state answers "no opinion" and the page trusts its own array.

   3. Set the secrets (`wrangler secret put NAME`, one at a time):
        RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET   from Razorpay Dashboard -> Webhooks
        GITHUB_TOKEN              fine-grained PAT, scoped ONLY to the
                                   KAAL repo, Contents: Read and write.
                                   It does NOT need Workflows, and must
                                   not be given it.
      And the plain vars in wrangler.toml: GITHUB_OWNER, GITHUB_REPO,
      EDITION, ALLOW_ORIGIN.

   4. In Razorpay Dashboard -> Webhooks, add an endpoint pointing at the
      deployed worker's root URL, subscribe to `payment.captured`, use
      the same secret as RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET. Razorpay shows the
      secret once, at creation — save it immediately.

   5. On the Payment Page, confirm the custom field capturing the chosen
      number is literally named `kaal_no`. That is the only reason this
      chain works.

   6. Put the deployed URL into index.html as `api:` in the KAAL config.
      Leave it empty and the page behaves exactly as it does today.

   7. Send one real ₹1 test transaction before trusting this with a real
      ₹5,999 one. Watch `wrangler tail`, watch the commit land, watch the
      live site's count move. Do this before turning Meta ads on.
